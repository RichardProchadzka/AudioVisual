# AudioVisual
Audiovisual is youtube-dl with ffmpeg GUI hosted via nginx and PHP. (I know PHP.... blah, blah... But it works!)

This project was created because I wanted some youtube-dl GUI on my weak OrangePI board.
I saw a lot of cool GUI`s on Github but none of them was suitable for my weak OrangePI :D.
When I started this project I thought that ffmpeg feature will be nice to have so I added basic conversion with basic video and audio formats.
Also you can get notification via Telegram.

If you find something that can improve this project feel free to help me improve this project.
